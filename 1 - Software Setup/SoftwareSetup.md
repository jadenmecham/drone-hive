# Setup Your Computer
This is the setup for the computer that will control the drone. Your laptop is a good idea.
## Install Ubuntu
To setup your computer, you will first need to install the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system onto your computer. ***IMPORTANT:*** Do not install Ubuntu 24.04. It is only compatible with ROS2. We use ROS1, so we have to use Ubuntu 20.04. Follow these steps:
1. Download an image of Ubuntu 20.04 [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)
2. Follow [these instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) to flash your computer with Ubuntu. Note that you will need a USB drive. You can either install Ubuntu alongside your current operating system or erase your current operating system. Either way works!
## Install ROS and Dependencies
This installs Robot Operating System (ROS) and all the required dependencies so we can run code on the drone later. 
1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/uf-reef-avl/reef_auto_install) to your computer with ```git clone https://github.com/uf-reef-avl/reef_auto_install```
