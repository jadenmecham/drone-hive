# Setup Your Computer
This is the setup for the computer that will control the drone. Your laptop is a good idea.
## Install Ubuntu
To setup your computer, you will first need to install the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system onto your computer. ***IMPORTANT:*** Do not install Ubuntu 24.04. It is only compatible with ROS2. We use ROS1, so we have to use Ubuntu 20.04.
