# Controller Binding
This is how to bind the [Taranis Q X7 Controller](https://www.frsky-rc.com/product/taranis-q-x7-2/) to the [X8R Receiver](https://www.frsky-rc.com/product/x8r/) which is on the drone. This allows the controller to send commands to the drone. This process also requires a microSD card.
## Download Firmware
The controller and reveiver both need to be flashed with the correct firmware. 
1. Download the [controller firmware](https://www.frsky-rc.com/xjt/) and [receiver firmware](https://www.frsky-rc.com/x8r/). Make sure that the controller and receiver firmware are the same version. v2.1.0 is the latest version as of writing this and this version works. An older version of the firmware is also available for download.
2. Within both firmware packages, there are two version of the firmware: FCC and LBT. Make sure to use the FCC firmware and not LBT in the next steps. FCC is for international use while LBT is for Europe.
3. Copy the correct firmware files onto the microSD card.
4. Then, plug the microSD card into the controller. Make sure that the controller is powered off before doing this.
5. Once the microSD card is inserted, power the controller on. Once booted up, select the microSD card slot as the storage device.
