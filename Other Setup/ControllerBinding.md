# Controller Binding
This is how to bind the [Taranis Q X7 Controller](https://www.frsky-rc.com/product/taranis-q-x7-2/) to the [X8R Receiver](https://www.frsky-rc.com/product/x8r/) which is on the drone. This allows the controller to send commands to the drone. 
## Download Firmware
The controller and reveiver both need to be flashed with the correct firmware. Download the [controller firmware](https://www.frsky-rc.com/xjt/) and [receiver firmware](https://www.frsky-rc.com/x8r/). 
***Important:*** Make sure that the controller and receiver firmware are the same version. v2.1.0 is the latest version as of writing this and this version works. An older version of the firmware is also available for download.
