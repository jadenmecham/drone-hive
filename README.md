# Scarab
Scarab drone at University of Nevada, Reno in the [van Breugel Lab](https://github.com/vanbreugel-lab). This is a copy of a drone built by Austin Lopez ([@Alopez6991](https://github.com/Alopez6991)) at UNR in collaboration with REEF - Autonomous Vehicles Lab with some changes to suit my needs.
